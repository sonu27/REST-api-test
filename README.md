codetest
========

A Symfony project created on August 22, 2015, 12:25 pm.

Objective of the test: imagine you have a website with users, and those users can write comments. Your task is to add a REST API to the backend for a new feature: the possibility for users to rate comments written by other users.
­ Install the PHP framework and setup a MySQL database.
­ Create a model in the database for the entities: users, comments (and later ratings).
­ Create 2 REST endpoints:
­ one to rate a comment (a rating is a thumb up or a thumb down).
­ one to get the total score (sum of ratings) for a comment.
­ Write some unit tests.
­ Ideally, use git to version your work, like you would on a real project.
